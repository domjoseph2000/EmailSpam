# EmailSpam

In the digital era, email remains a cornerstone of personal and professional communication. Yet its widespread adoption has amplified the persistent issue of spamâ€”unsolicited messages that congest inboxes and introduce cybersecurity threats. To address these challenges, this project develops an automated spam classification system designed to efficiently differentiate legitimate ("ham") emails from unwanted ("spam") content, enhancing email management and security.

The exercise's core objective is to create a robust classifier by generating discriminative feature sets from tokenized email data. Feature extraction, a pivotal stage in Natural Language Processing, involves identifying linguistic patterns and keyword relevance that inform classification decisions. By optimizing this process and training an accurate model, the system aims to achieve high-precision spam detection, offering a scalable solution to combat evolving email-based threats.
